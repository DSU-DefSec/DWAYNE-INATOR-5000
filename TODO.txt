Scoring Engine todos:

- Start/stop scoring button
  - Should admin-only accessible
  - Should disable/enable inject scores being shown on status page
  
- Nuke DB button
  - Should be admin-only (ofc)
  - Just deletes all records. Ensure that you're not currently scoring, wipe in-memory caches
  
- Separation of checks
  - Move check code to external lib (dsu-defsec/checks)
  - Will let us use them elsewhere easier
  
- Inject grader queue
  - List of ungraded injects. Last valid submission for each team for each inject (if exists)
  
- Inject "taken" notice
  - Change inject status when currently being graded (to avoid two people grading the same inject)
  
- Web-based 'create inject' form
  - Be able to add inject to be posted immediately or at a given time
  - (Multiple) file upload, description, etc
  
- Inject creation API
  - Should integrate with injects.py (dsu-defsec/injects.py)
  - Same functionality as web based form. Should use same backend
  
- Check testing and functionality improvement
